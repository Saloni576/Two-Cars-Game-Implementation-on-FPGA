# Two-Cars-FPGA-game
This project implements the "Two Cars" game on the Basys3 board. 
The objective of the game: 
* Don't hit the squares. Game over if you hit the square.
* Don't miss the circles. Each circle adds to your score.
* Drive two cars at the same time.
The score is displayed using a seven-segment display on the FPGA.
